Description: The ForestAnalysisInR package connects users to the plethora
    of applications, packages, and datasets that exist for forest ecology and 
    forestry research for the R environment. The package includes functions that
    import data regarding extant R packages specific to forest related research,
    and provides information on their primary applications. Further, the package 
    includes a Shiny-based app that can be run local, that provides an interactive
    look at the same data.
